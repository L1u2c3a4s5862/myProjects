in the `passwords/` file, please run `gcc -o passgen passgen.c` and `g++ -o passwordgen passwordgen.cpp` to get the executable file. Then run `cp <scripts> /usr/local/bin` so that you can run these codes from anywhere, if your Linux OS do not have `/usr/local/bin` file, please change every code `#!/usr/local/bin/python` to `#!/usr/bin/python3` and run the  command again.
